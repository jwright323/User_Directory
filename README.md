## Description

This application allows users to view their company's employee directory to quickly obtain information on each employee. Its React functionality lets the user search for a specific employee, view that employee's listed information and sort the employees by either name, phone, email and/or DOB. When you search for an employee, it will immediately display their info.

## Installation

1. git clone: git@github.com/jwright323/userdirectory.git
2. Run npm start
3. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### Built with:
* Javascript
* [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react/)
* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [npm axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
* [npm gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)
* [Visual Studio Code](code.visualstudio.com)

## Usage

An employee and/or manager having access to view non-sensitive data about other employees would be a great way for the user to get in contact with coworker or even assist with coordinating monthly birthday celebrations. When the user loads the page, a table of employees will populate. The user will be able to:

* Sort the table by at least one category.
* Filter the users by at least one property.
